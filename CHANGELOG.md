#### 3. Database-Specific Implementation

##### PostgreSQL/Redshift Enhancements:
```sql
-- Advanced user query with role membership
SELECT r.rolname, r.rolsuper, r.rolcreaterole, r.rolcreatedb, r.rolcanlogin,
       array_agg(DISTINCT role_roles.rolname) as member_of_roles,
       CASE WHEN NOT r.rolcanlogin THEN 'role_only'
            WHEN r.rolsuper THEN 'superuser'
            WHEN r.rolcreaterole OR r.rolcreatedb THEN 'admin'
            ELSE 'normal' END as computed_type
FROM pg_roles r
LEFT JOIN pg_auth_members m ON r.oid = m.member
LEFT JOIN pg_roles role_roles ON m.roleid = role_roles.oid
WHERE r.rolname NOT LIKE 'pg_%'
GROUP BY r.rolname, r.rolsuper, r.rolcreaterole, r.rolcreatedb, r.rolcanlogin;

-- Role members query
SELECT r.rolname, 
       array_agg(DISTINCT member_roles.rolname) as member_names
FROM pg_roles r
LEFT JOIN pg_auth_members m ON r.oid = m.roleid
LEFT JOIN pg_roles member_roles ON m.member = member_roles.oid
WHERE NOT r.rolcanlogin AND r.rolname NOT LIKE 'pg_%'
GROUP BY r.rolname;
```

##### MySQL Enhancements:
```sql
-- User privileges query
SELECT DISTINCT u.user, u.host, u.account_locked,
       GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT p.privilege_type) as privileges
FROM mysql.user u
LEFT JOIN information_schema.user_privileges p ON u.user = p.grantee
WHERE u.user NOT IN ('mysql.sys', 'mysql.session', 'mysql.infoschema', 'root')
GROUP BY u.user, u.host, u.account_locked;

-- MySQL 8.0+ roles support
SELECT role_name, 
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.role_edges WHERE to_role = r.role_name) as members
FROM mysql.user r WHERE is_role = 'Y';
```

##### Redis ACL Support:
```python
# Redis ACL parsing
acl_users = r.acl_list()
for user_acl in acl_users:
    user_name = user_acl.split()[1]
    is_active = 'on' in user_acl.lower()
    permissions = re.findall(r'\+@(\w+)', user_acl)
```

### üîß Core Functions Added

#### Database Connection & Execution
```python
def execute_sql_command(server_info, sql_command, fetch_results=False):
    """Execute SQL command on live database with error handling"""
    
def generate_user_sql_commands(db_type, action, old_username, **kwargs):
    """Generate database-specific SQL for user operations"""
```

#### User Management Operations
- **User Creation**: `CREATE ROLE "username" WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password'`
- **User Modification**: `ALTER ROLE "username" WITH SUPERUSER/NOSUPERUSER`
- **Password Changes**: `ALTER ROLE "username" WITH PASSWORD 'newpass'`
- **Account Toggle**: `ALTER ROLE "username" WITH LOGIN/NOLOGIN`

#### Role Management Operations
- **Grant Role**: `GRANT "role_name" TO "username"`

if success:
    st.success(f"‚úÖ Command executed: {result}")
else:
    st.error(f"‚ùå Error: {result}")
```

## üìã Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Redis Role Management**: Limited by Redis ACL capabilities
2. **MySQL 5.7**: No native role support, uses privilege-based simulation
3. **Connection Pooling**: Not implemented, may impact performance with many concurrent operations
4. **Password Policy**: No enforced password complexity rules

### Technical Debt
1. **Code Duplication**: Some SQL generation logic repeated across database types
2. **Error Messages**: Could be more user-friendly for non-technical users
3. **Testing Coverage**: Unit tests needed for core functions
4. **Documentation**: API documentation for SQL generation functions needed

## üîí Security Considerations

### Implemented Security Measures
- SQL parameterization to prevent injection attacks
- Credential encryption in session state
- Connection timeout handling
- Input validation for usernames and role names

### Security Recommendations for Production
1. Use encrypted connections (SSL/TLS) for all database communications
2. Implement proper credential rotation policies
3. Enable database audit logging
4. Regular security reviews of granted permissions
5. Monitor for suspicious user management activities
